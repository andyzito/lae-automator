# The LAE Automator

The LAE Automator assists in the process of creating a new version of the [Moodle Liberal Arts Edition](https://www.clamp-it.org/get-involved/moodle-liberal-arts-edition-lae/) fork maintained by [CLAMP](https://www.clamp-it.org/), based on an upstream Moodle Core version. The algorithm is described in [these instructions](https://github.com/CLAMP-IT/moodle/wiki/Integration-Procedures).
